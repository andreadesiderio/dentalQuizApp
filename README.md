## Problem
 Originally, I had the hero page, quiz page and final result page as three diffrent html files. This required too many reloads. I fixed this by using Javascript and Jquery to manipulate the DOM and go back to the begining without having to reload the page. This also created a smoother user experiance.
 I will improve this app by making it all one html file so that there is only one page load at the begining.
